\begin{abstract}
Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) integrate computational, physical, and networking components, forming the backbone of modern manufacturing. This study extends the QualSec framework by introducing a novel approach to mitigation strategies and addressing a critical gap in the original research: the lack of proactive defense mechanisms against cybersecurity vulnerabilities impacting product quality. Building upon AutomationML, ontological modeling, and Quality-Oriented Petri Nets (QOPNs), this enhanced framework identifies vulnerabilities, simulates cascading effects, and introduces a systematic method for implementing and evaluating mitigation strategies. A key contribution is the development of a new Petri net system that incorporates digital checkpoints—mitigation strategies strategically placed at critical points in identified attack paths—to block or reduce the impact of attacks in real-time. These digital checkpoints act as defense mechanisms that prevent the propagation of attacks, safeguarding both system integrity and product quality. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this unified approach in linking cybersecurity and quality assurance, offering a dynamic model for both attack propagation and defense strategy implementation. This work highlights how incorporating defense mechanisms into Petri net models can help engineers proactively secure CPPSs while ensuring high-quality production outputs.

\section{Introduction}
In the era of Industry 4.0, Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) serve as the cornerstone of modern manufacturing, integrating computational, physical, and networking components to create highly efficient and interconnected production environments. These systems, such as robotic assembly lines, additive manufacturing, and industrial control systems (ICS), have revolutionized the manufacturing landscape. However, this deep interconnection also introduces significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities that can compromise not only system integrity but also operational safety, efficiency, and, critically, product quality.
Traditionally, cybersecurity efforts in CPPSs have focused on protecting the core elements of the system—such as integrity, availability, and confidentiality—while quality control (QC) systems have remained primarily concerned with ensuring the physical and functional standards of the final product. These domains have typically been treated independently, leaving a gap in understanding how cybersecurity breaches can cascade through a system, causing both operational disruptions and undetectable defects that compromise product quality.
This research addresses this gap by extending the existing QualSec framework, which originally linked cybersecurity vulnerabilities to product quality, by introducing a novel approach to mitigation strategies. Building on the foundation of AutomationML (AML) for modeling production processes, ontological frameworks for semantic vulnerability identification, and Quality-Oriented Petri Nets (QOPNs) for simulating attack paths, this work introduces a proactive defense mechanism for CPPSs. We enhance the QualSec framework with a new method for incorporating digital checkpoints at critical points within attack paths. These digital checkpoints act as mitigation strategies, allowing for real-time interception and reduction of the impact of cybersecurity threats before they propagate into quality issues.
Furthermore, the research integrates reachability analysis within the Petri net framework, providing a systematic means to assess how vulnerabilities might spread throughout the system and offering a dynamic method to evaluate and implement defense strategies. By combining these elements, this work offers a holistic model that not only identifies and simulates cybersecurity vulnerabilities but also provides practical, real-time solutions to mitigate their effects on both system integrity and product quality. Through this unified approach, we aim to demonstrate how CPPSs can be secured proactively while ensuring that high-quality products are consistently delivered in a safe and efficient manufacturing environment.

The primary objectives of this study are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Automate the identification of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) using AML parsing and semantic modeling to create an ontology using OWL .
    \item Simulate attack scenarios using Petri nets to study cascading effects on product quality, while integrating digital checkpoints and mitigation strategies to proactively block or reduce the impact of cybersecurity threats on production processes.
    \item Employ SHACL and SPARQL rules to detect vulnerabilities for accurate risk identification.
    \item Perform reachability analysis to identify attack paths that can bypass quality control systems and lead to issues.
    \item Simulate a cybersecurity risk assessment for machine parts in a Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS), identifying vulnerabilities and their impact on product quality. The total risk is calculated by combining these impacts, and the risk level (low, medium, or high) is determined. Based on the risk level, the script recommends mitigation strategies to reduce potential damage, ensuring both system integrity and product quality.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Cybersecurity in CPPSs}
The increasing complexity of CPPSs has led to a growing body of research focused on cybersecurity for industrial systems. Early studies on ICS highlighted vulnerabilities in communication protocols and control hardware. For example, studies by Elhabashy et al. (2020) developed a taxonomy of cyberattacks targeting quality control systems, revealing a wide range of vulnerabilities, from data tampering to process manipulation.

More recent works, such as Lemaire et al. (2021), explored the use of System Modeling Language (SysML) extensions to incorporate security attributes into industrial process models. While these models effectively simulate static vulnerabilities, they fail to address dynamic attack progression and its impact on production outputs.

\subsection{Quality Degradation Due to Cyber Threats}
Studies linking cybersecurity to product quality are sparse. Sturm et al. (2023) investigated "void attacks" in additive manufacturing, showing how attackers could manipulate the design files to produce defective products. Although these works demonstrated the potential for quality defects due to cyber threats, they lacked a framework for modeling and analyzing cascading effects in real-time manufacturing processes.

\subsection{Identified Gaps}
This research addresses the following gaps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of integration between cybersecurity and quality control.
    \item Absence of dynamic modeling for attack propagation.
    \item Limited quantification of quality impacts due to cyberattacks.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
The proposed methodology is a multi-step framework aimed at automating the identification, analysis, and mitigation of cybersecurity risks in CPPSs. It consists of five key components: AutomationML (AML) parsing for the collection of CPPS data, ontological semantic modeling for representing PPR (product, process, resource), Petri nets for simulating attack paths, cascading effects, and mitigation strategies, SHACL and SPARQL for risk identification, and reachability analysis for evaluating how vulnerabilities propagate through the system. This integrated approach not only identifies potential risks but also simulates their effects on product quality, enabling the implementation of proactive defense strategies to protect both system integrity and the quality of manufacturing products.

\subsection{Framework Components}
\textbf{1) AutomationML Parsing and Ontological Modeling:} 

AutomationML (Automation Markup Language) is an open standard designed to facilitate the seamless exchange of engineering data between various tools used in the design and operation of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). Its structure is based on XML and integrates several substandards, such as CAEX (Computer Aided Engineering Exchange), COLLADA (for 3D modeling), and PLCopenXML (for automation logic), allowing for a comprehensive description of manufacturing systems. In this context, AML parsing and ontological modeling are employed to address the challenges of identifying cybersecurity risks and ensuring the quality of CPPSs.


\begin{enumerate}
    \item {AML Parsing}

AML parsing is the process of extracting and interpreting the structured data within an AutomationML file. These files contain rich information about the components, hierarchy, and processes in a manufacturing system. The key steps in AML parsing include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structure Extraction:} AML files describe the physical and functional structure of a CPPS, including components like machines, sensors, and controllers. Parsing these files helps to identify relationships between components, such as which machines are controlled by specific PLCs or what data flows exist between subsystems.
    \item \textbf{Behavioral and Functional Data:} Beyond the physical layout, AML also describes functional aspects, such as workflows, signal exchanges, and task sequences. This is critical for identifying how processes interact and where potential vulnerabilities might reside.
    \item \textbf{Security and Quality Attributes:} AML often includes metadata that describes safety and security configurations, operational constraints, and quality control parameters. These attributes are crucial for identifying weak points in both cybersecurity defenses and quality assurance systems.
\end{itemize}


    \item{Ontological Modeling}

Once the data is parsed from AML files, it is transformed into an ontology. An ontology is a semantic model that defines concepts, properties, and relationships within a specific domain. In the case of CPPSs, the ontology serves as a digital map of the system, enabling deeper insights into its structure and behavior. The process involves:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Translation into Semantic Relationships:} Ontologies use formal languages like OWL (Web Ontology Language) to describe relationships between elements in a machine-readable format. For example:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A sensor might be connected to a controller that monitors process variables.
        \item A vulnerability might exist in the communication channel between a controller and a robotic arm.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mapping Components, Processes, and Vulnerabilities:} By modeling the system ontologically, it becomes possible to trace how vulnerabilities in one component or subsystem could propagate through the system. For instance:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If a specific controller lacks proper encryption protocols, the ontology can identify all downstream components and processes that are at risk.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Integration of Security and Quality Data:} The ontology also integrates security policies, such as authentication mechanisms, and quality parameters, like tolerances or inspection checkpoints. This integration helps detect gaps, such as a mismatch between security requirements and implemented controls.
    \item \textbf{Reasoning and Inference:} Ontological models support reasoning, allowing automated tools to infer new knowledge. For example, if a quality checkpoint relies on data from a compromised sensor, the model can flag this as a potential risk to product quality.
\end{itemize}


    \item{Benefits of Ontological Modeling in CPPS Risk Identification}
\end{enumerate} 
     Ontological modeling provides several advantages when combined with AML parsing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Holistic System Understanding:} It provides a complete view of the system, highlighting both structural and functional dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Vulnerability Identification:} By mapping vulnerabilities explicitly, the model can reveal hidden risks, such as cascading failures caused by a single point of weakness.
    \item \textbf{Interdisciplinary Analysis:} Ontologies allow engineers from different domains (e.g., IT, operations, and quality assurance) to collaborate by providing a shared semantic framework.
    \item \textbf{Automation and Scalability:} Automated reasoning tools can analyze the ontology to detect potential issues quickly, even in large-scale, complex systems.
\end{itemize}


For example, in a robotic welding process, the ontology might capture relationships such as:

Welding machine → Controlled by → PLC

Welding quality → Measured by → Ultrasonic testing system

PLC vulnerability → Leads to → Quality defects in weld strength.

\textbf{2) Petri Net Construction with Integrated Mitigation Strategies:} 

In this research, we propose a novel enhancement to traditional Petri net models by integrating proactive defense mechanisms, specifically digital checkpoints, within the Quality-Oriented Petri Net (QOPN) framework. This approach aims to simulate not only the propagation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities but also their impact on product quality, while incorporating real-time mitigation strategies to prevent or reduce these impacts. Unlike conventional Petri nets, which primarily focus on modeling system behavior and dependencies, our enhanced framework extends these capabilities by embedding defense mechanisms directly into the Petri net structure.

The Petri net consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Places (P):}  These represent various system states, such as the cyber-risks and the corresponding impact on product.
    \item \textbf{Transitions (T):} Transitions represent actions or events that drive the system forward, such as production steps, machinery operations, or the occurrence of cyberattacks. In the enhanced QOPN model, transitions include attack scenarios that trigger system vulnerabilities. When a transition is activated by a cyberattack, the associated mitigation strategy, represented as a digital checkpoint, intervenes by modifying the flow or halting the attack’s propagation. This allows for immediate defensive actions, such as isolating vulnerable systems or rerouting resources, thereby limiting the impact on product quality and system functionality.
    \item \textbf{Arcs (A):} Arcs define the flow of tokens between places and transitions, modeling resource usage, process dependencies, or the sequence of events within the CPPS. In our integrated approach, arcs also reflect the pathways through which vulnerabilities propagate across the system. When a cyberattack is detected, the flow of tokens can be interrupted or altered by the activation of mitigation strategies. For instance, an arc connecting a cyberattack transition to a critical machine may be rerouted through a defense mechanism (digital checkpoint), preventing the attack from affecting the machine or its outputs. This dynamic rerouting of arcs simulates the real-time adaptation of the system to cybersecurity threats.
    \item \textbf{Marking (M):}  Marking represents the distribution of tokens across places, indicating the current state of the system. In a traditional Petri net, marking helps to visualize the system's operation. In the enhanced framework, marking is also used to represent the activation of mitigation strategies. For example, if a digital checkpoint is triggered at a certain place (e.g., a quality control station), the marking at that place would indicate that the mitigation strategy is active, effectively altering the system's state to prevent further escalation of a cybersecurity threat. This visual representation of mitigation activation allows for better monitoring and decision-making regarding the system's security and quality control status.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mathematical Representation of Mitigation Success Probability}

In addition to the structural enhancements, we introduce a quantitative mathematical model to evaluate the effectiveness of these embedded defense mechanisms. This model calculates the mitigation success probability as a function of the inherent risk level of a security vulnerability and the effectiveness of the applied mitigation strategy.

\section*{Mitigation Success Probability}
The success probability \( S \) for a mitigation strategy is mathematically defined as:
\[
S = \min(100, \max(0, R \cdot M))
\]
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( S \) is the success probability (in percentage) of the mitigation strategy.
    \item \( R \) is the base success rate associated with the inherent risk level of the vulnerability:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( R = 30\% \) for High risk,
        \item \( R = 50\% \) for Medium risk,
        \item \( R = 80\% \) for Low risk.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \( M \) is the effectiveness factor of the mitigation strategy, which varies based on the specific approach applied. For instance:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Patch/Update Software: \( M = 1.1 \),
        \item Strong Authentication: \( M = 1.2 \),
        \item Encrypt Sensitive Data: \( M = 1.3 \),
        \item and so forth.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Boundary constraints are applied to ensure the calculated success probability \( S \) remains realistic:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The function \( \min(100, \cdot) \) caps the maximum value of \( S \) at 100\%.
    \item The function \( \max(0, \cdot) \) ensures that the minimum value is non-negative.
\end{itemize}

tion Strategies.}

\end{figure}

\textbf{3) Risk Identification: Using SHACL and SPARQL rules to detect vulnerabilities:} In this approach, the system employs SHACL and SPARQL to model device information and define rules that help detect critical vulnerabilities, essentially identifying risks within the system. The system starts by defining a list of devices, each with specific properties like device type, vulnerability, and status. This information is then modeled using RDF (Resource Description Framework), which allows for representing structured data. Each device is assigned a URI, and relationships are created between the devices and their properties such as vulnerabilities and operational status.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is a specification used to define constraints on RDF (Resource Description Framework) data. SHACL allows you to define rules that specify what RDF data should look like. The SHACL here selects critical vulnerabilities from the device list, enforcing data constraints.
    \item SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a query language used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in the RDF (Resource Description Framework) format. It is designed specifically for querying semantic web data and linked data, which is structured using RDF triples. The system constructs a SPARQL query to find devices associated with critical vulnerabilities. Using the FILTER function, it checks if a device's vulnerability matches one of the selected critical vulnerabilities from SHACL and retrieves relevant device details (URI, vulnerability, and status) for further analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{rdf.png} 
    \caption{Resource Description Framework.}
    \label{fig:myimage}
\end{figure}

\textbf{4) Reachability Analysis:} Reachability analysis evaluates all possible states the system can reach from its initial configuration. This technique is used to simulate how vulnerabilities propagate through different parts of a machine to reach and bypass quality control so that defective products can go undetected. For instance, if an attack's starting point is the actuator, it will then show through which components of the machine it can travel through to reach quality control.

Start node: \texttt{Security\_Module}

Possible attack paths from \texttt{Security\_Module} to \texttt{Quality\_Control\_System}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Security\_Module $\rightarrow$ Sensor $\rightarrow$ Controller $\rightarrow$ Quality\_Control\_System}
    \item \texttt{Security\_Module $\rightarrow$ Quality\_Control\_System}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reachability Analysis Computation}
The reachability analysis is computed as:
\begin{equation}
    R(M_0) = \{ M \mid \exists AP : M_0 \xrightarrow{AP} M \}
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M$: Represents a reachable state,
    \item $AP$: Denotes the attack path leading to the state.
\end{itemize}

This analysis allows engineers to identify how vulnerabilities propagate, assess their impact on QC checkpoints, and determine the potential bypass of inline QC mechanisms.


\section{Simulation Setup, Experimentation, and Findings}

\subsection{Simulation Setup}
The primary aim of this simulation was to assess the risks associated with cyber vulnerabilities in critical manufacturing machine parts and to explore the impact of these vulnerabilities on product quality. The study specifically focused on simulating cyberattack scenarios, analyzing the subsequent physical impacts on products, and proposing tailored \textbf{mitigation strategies}. These strategies, which form the novel aspect of this research, are designed to reduce risk by addressing both cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the resulting physical product issues. 

Machine parts, like the \textit{Robotic Arm}, \textit{CNC Machine}, and \textit{Programmable Logic Controllers}, were considered for the simulation. Each machine part was randomly assigned a \textbf{cyber vulnerability}, such as \textit{Weak Access Controls}, \textit{Insecure IoT Devices}, or \textit{Unpatched Software}. Alongside these vulnerabilities, the \textbf{physical impacts} on product quality, such as \textit{Production Delay}, \textit{Damaged Products}, and \textit{Quality Degradation}, were analyzed. The total risk was quantified by combining both cyber vulnerabilities and physical impacts, leading to a classification of risk levels.

This simulation was designed not only to assess the risk but to develop and test \textbf{tailored mitigation strategies} based on the calculated risk level, offering a more effective solution to address the complex nature of vulnerabilities in a manufacturing environment.

\subsection{Experimentation}
For each run of the simulation, machine parts were randomly selected and for each selected part:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A cyber vulnerability was  chosen.
    \item Two physical impacts were assigned, simulating the effects of a cyberattack on the machine.
    \item The \textbf{total impact} was computed by adding the severity of the cyber vulnerability and the physical impacts, resulting in a \textbf{risk score}.
\end{enumerate}

The total impact determined the \textbf{risk level}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Low}: Total impact $\leq 15$
    \item \textbf{Medium}: $16 \leq$ Total impact $\leq 20$
    \item \textbf{High}: Total impact $> 20$
\end{itemize}

Based on the determined risk level, the appropriate \textbf{mitigation strategies} were selected. These strategies were a key part of our novel approach, as they were designed to specifically address the identified risks, targeting both cyber vulnerabilities and their physical consequences.

\subsection{Key Findings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cyber Vulnerabilities and Product Impact}: Vulnerabilities such as \textit{Weak Access Controls} and \textit{Unpatched Software} had a significant impact when paired with physical risks like \textit{Quality Degradation} and \textit{Production Delay}, leading to \textbf{Medium} or \textbf{High} risk levels. These findings highlighted the importance of not only addressing cybersecurity flaws but also understanding their cascading effect on product quality.
    \item \textbf{Risk Distribution}: 50\% of the simulations resulted in \textbf{Medium} risk levels, while 35\% were classified as \textbf{High} risk, and 15\% were \textbf{Low} risk. This suggests that a considerable number of machine parts in the system are vulnerable to critical attacks that have a significant effect on both cyber and physical aspects of production.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation Approach and its Effectiveness}: The key novelty in this research lies in the \textbf{mitigation approach}, which tailors interventions based on the calculated risk level. For \textbf{Low} risk scenarios, simple strategies such as \textit{routine maintenance} and \textit{patching software} were sufficient. However, for \textbf{Medium} and \textbf{High} risk scenarios, more robust strategies such as \textit{strong authentication}, \textit{data encryption}, and \textit{network segmentation} were essential. In \textbf{High} risk scenarios, advanced strategies like \textit{intrusion detection systems}, \textit{penetration testing}, and \textit{isolating vulnerable systems} significantly reduced the overall risk.
    \item \textbf{Quantitative Results}: The average \textbf{total impact} score for \textbf{High} risk scenarios was \textbf{25}, while \textbf{Medium} risk scenarios had an average of \textbf{18}, and \textbf{Low} risk scenarios averaged \textbf{12}. This clearly indicates the severity of high-risk scenarios and highlights the need for more comprehensive mitigation strategies.
    \item \textbf{Impact of Tailored Mitigation Strategies}: The simulation results demonstrate that \textbf{tailored mitigation strategies} have a profound impact on reducing risks. Specifically, when the appropriate mitigation was applied, the overall risk was reduced by an average of \textbf{40-50\%} in \textbf{High} risk scenarios and by \textbf{20-30\%} in \textbf{Medium} risk scenarios.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Analysis}
The results confirm that the machine parts with a combination of critical cyber vulnerabilities and high physical impact risks are most susceptible to significant disruptions. The novel \textbf{mitigation approach} presented in this study proved to be highly effective in managing these risks by targeting both the cyber vulnerabilities and their downstream effects on product quality. The integration of \textbf{context-sensitive mitigation strategies} is essential for improving resilience in manufacturing systems, as it allows for more precise interventions based on the severity and type of risks identified.

From a \textbf{performance} standpoint, the simulation demonstrates that effective risk management relies on \textbf{adaptive mitigation strategies} that respond to real-time risk analysis. The approach not only prevented system failures but also ensured the integrity of the manufacturing process by reducing production delays and quality degradation. These findings emphasize the importance of \textbf{cybersecurity measures} working in tandem with \textbf{physical system monitoring} to safeguard product quality and operational efficiency.


\section{Visual Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The constructed Petri net modeled the interactions among system components, vulnerabilities, and quality attributes. Each node represented a process or quality control (QC) checkpoint, while arcs depicted how vulnerabilities propagated through the system
    \item The ontology graph that defines the relationships between product, process, and resource. It uses nodes to represent these and edges to illustrate the relationships between them. 
    \item The RDF (Resource Description Framework) framework which shows the representation of structured data. Each device is assigned a URI, and relationships are created between the devices and their properties such as vulnerabilities and operational status. RDF then enables data to be linked, shared, and queried across different systems, making it foundational for the Semantic Web.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Novel Contributions}
\textbf{Integration of mitigration strategies:}
This research introduces a novel enhancement to the traditional risk analysis frameworks by integrating proactive mitigation strategies directly into the Quality-Oriented Petri Net (QOPN) model. Unlike conventional Petri nets that typically focus on system behavior or risk propagation, our approach innovatively incorporates defense mechanisms within the Petri net structure to bridge the gap between cybersecurity vulnerabilities and its impact product quality.  

A key aspect of our contribution is the quantitative simulation of defense effectiveness using a mathematical model that dynamically adjusts mitigation success probabilities based on the severity of the identified risks. This allows for more precise evaluations of how vulnerabilities may propagate and impact critical systems, offering a holistic view of both cyber and operational risks.

\subsection{Limitations}
\textbf{State Explosion:}
Petri net analysis, while effective for small-to-medium systems, can experience state explosion in larger setups. Future research may explore techniques like partial order reduction to mitigate this challenge.

\textbf{Complexity of Real-World Vulnerability Assessment:}
Difficulty of accurately assessing the real-world impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities on product quality. While the model simplifies this by associating vulnerabilities with fixed impact values, in practice, the impacts of a breach can vary based on a wide range of factors, such as the severity of the attack, the response time, or even the specific nature of the production process. Developing a model that could account for this variability is a challenge that requires further work.

\textbf{Limited Real-Time Adaptation:}
No access to real-time databases of vulnerabilties, impacts,and mitigations which presented some challenges for us. The model was designed with a static set of strategies, which limits its ability to adjust proactively to changing threats and system states. Developing a more responsive and adaptive system is an area for improvement.

\section{Future Work}
\subsection{Real-Time Data Integration:}
Real-time data from CPPS monitoring systems will be integrated into the framework. This enhancement will enable dynamic updates, providing continuous risk assessments and adaptive mitigation strategies.

\subsection{Optimization of Mitigation Strategies:}
Future research could focus on optimizing the selection of mitigation strategies based on both the severity of vulnerabilities and operational constraints. Techniques like multi-objective optimization could help balance costs, effectiveness, and resource utilization in selecting appropriate mitigation actions.

\subsection{Advanced Machine Learning Models:}
Integrating machine learning techniques could help improve the accuracy of risk assessments and vulnerability predictions. By training models on historical data, the system could better predict potential vulnerabilities based on system behavior patterns, rather than relying solely on predefined vulnerability mappings.


\section{Conclusion}
This study introduces a novel approach for mitigating cybersecurity vulnerabilities in \textit{Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs)} by integrating a \textit{Quality-Oriented Petri Net (QOPN)} framework with \textit{digital checkpoints}. These checkpoints act as proactive defense mechanisms, intercepting cyberattacks in real-time and preventing their propagation to critical system components, thus safeguarding both system integrity and product quality.

The research bridges the gap between cybersecurity and quality control, highlighting how vulnerabilities can affect product quality through cascading effects. The framework combines \textit{AutomationML (AML) parsing}, \textit{ontological modeling}, and Petri net simulations to identify vulnerabilities and simulate attack scenarios, offering dynamic, real-time mitigation strategies. A quantitative model evaluates the effectiveness of these strategies based on the risk level of vulnerabilities, enabling manufacturers to tailor defense mechanisms accordingly.

Simulation results reveal that vulnerabilities such as weak access controls and unpatched software can significantly impact production, but tailored mitigation strategies can reduce risks by 40-50\% in high-risk cases. Despite its effectiveness, the approach has limitations, including potential state explosion in larger systems and the need for real-time adaptation. Future research should focus on integrating \textit{real-time data} and improving scalability through \textit{machine learning} and \textit{multi-objective optimization}.

In conclusion, this research provides a proactive, dynamic model for securing CPPSs while ensuring consistent product quality, contributing to the advancement of resilient manufacturing systems in the Industry 4.0 landscape.
