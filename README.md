# CPPS Simulation Project

Welcome to the **Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) Simulation** project! This project showcases a powerful simulation of industrial production systems using advanced data processing and monitoring techniques.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The CPPS Simulation demonstrates key concepts in modern production systems, including sensor data visualization, system modeling, and performance analysis. With the rise of Industry 4.0, understanding and simulating such systems can greatly enhance smart manufacturing processes.

## 🧰 Features
- **Data Visualization:** Real-time plots of sensor data.
- **System Simulation:** Model various production scenarios.
- **Performance Analysis:** Gain insights into production metrics.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `CPPS_simulation.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the simulation.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Running on Google Colab
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the file `CPPS_simulation.ipynb`.
